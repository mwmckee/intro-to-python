# The Adventures of Spaceman Spiff

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the gripping adventures of Spaceman Spiff!

## **About This Book**

This book is a collection of lessons, assignments, labs, and ideas for running an introductory computer science course. This material was originally designed for a [TEALS](http://tealsk12.org) course, and contains enough material to run a course that meets for 50 minutes a day, 5 days a week, for approximately 20 weeks. As with any cirruculum, this will vary greatly depending upon the students, teacher(s), class size, and class setting.

Not all of the material for this curriculum is currently Spaceman Spiff themed, a situation that will hopefully change soon!

## **Creators**

The orignal content in this Gitbook and Github repository was created by the TEALS teaching team for Quincy High School in the state of Washington in Spring of 2016 - Silvia Doomra and Juan Lema as volunteer teachers, Nicolas Cabeen, Joe Wandyez, Matt McKee, and Rakesh Veeramacheneni as volunteer teaching assistants, and Mark Ross Kondo as in-class teacher.

## **Github and Contribution**

Setting up the Github repository that backs this Gitbook is still in progress Soon, we&#39;ll welcome any contributions to be made through Github.
